## Acknowledgements
We are grateful to thousands of vegetation scientists who sampled vegetation plots in the field or digitized them into regional, national or international databases. 
We also appreciate the support of the German Research Foundation for funding sPlot as one of the iDiv (DFG FZT 118) research platforms, and the organization of three workshops through the sDiv calls. 
We acknowledge this support with naming the database “sPlot”, where the “s” refers to the sDiv synthesis workshops. 
The study was supported by the TRY initiative on plant traits ( http://www.try-db.org).
