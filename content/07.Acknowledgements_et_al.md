## Acknowledgements
We are grateful to thousands of vegetation scientists who sampled vegetation plots in the field or digitized them into regional, national or international databases. 
We also appreciate the support of the German Research Foundation for funding sPlot as one of the iDiv (DFG FZT 118, 202548816) research platforms, and the organization of three workshops through the sDiv calls. 
We acknowledge this support with naming the database “sPlot”, where the “s” refers to the sDiv synthesis workshops. 
The study was supported by the TRY initiative on plant traits (http://www.try-db.org). 
For all further acknowledgements see Appendix S10 in \[@doi:10.1111/jvs.12710\].  

## Author contributions
FMS wrote the first draft of the manuscript, with considerable input by JL and HB. JL and TH wrote the resampling algorithm. FMS set up the GiHub project and produced the graphs. He also coordinated the sPlot consortium. SMH wrote the Turboveg v3 software, which holds the sPlot database. JK provided the trait data from TRY and FS performed the trait data gap filling. HB secured the funding for sPlot as a strategic project of iDiv. All other authors contributed data. All authors contributed to revisng the manuscript.
